## Quiz File Format

Each quiz is a folder in `/tests/` containing:
- **quiz.csv**: Questions and answers in CSV format
- **Images**: Optional image files referenced in the CSV

### CSV Structure:
```csv
"What is 2+2?","What color is the sky?","Which is larger?"
"","sky.jpg","elephant.jpg"
"`4","Blue","Elephant"
"3","`Blue","`Elephant"
"5","Green","Mouse"
"6","Red","Cat"
```

**Format Rules:**
- **Row 1**: Question text
- **Row 2**: Image filename (optional, leave empty if no image)
- **Row 3+**: Answer options
- **Correct Answers**: Prefix with backtick `` ` `` (e.g., `` `4 ``)
- **Multiple Choice**: One correct answer = radio buttons
- **Multiple Select**: Multiple correct answers = checkboxes

## Configuration

### Owner Setup

```javascript
const ownerIdentities = [
    'owner@example.com',
    'teacher@school.edu'
];

```

### Adding New Quizzes
1. Create a new folder in `/tests/` (e.g., `/tests/myquiz/`)

3. Add any image files referenced in the CSV
